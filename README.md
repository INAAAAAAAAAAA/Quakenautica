## What is Quakenautica?

Quakenautica is a subnautica themed quake mod for the nintendo 3ds port of Quake (CtrQuake) and for windows.
Our idea is **not** to create another subnautica which is based on the quake engine. We want to tell our own story in the world of subnautica. We hope you'll enjoy that story.
